ðŸš€ The Programming Manifesto
ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I am a third-year student in professional school, completing my final year of studies.
This repository is more than just code â€” it represents my reflections, values, and vision of what programming means to me.

Through this Programming Manifesto, I want to express how I see programming not only as a technical skill, but also as a philosophy and a way of thinking.

ðŸ“– The Manifesto

Code is Communication
Programming is a language between humans as much as it is for machines. Good code should be clear, readable, and meaningful.

Simplicity is Strength
The most powerful solutions are often the simplest. Complexity should never be an obstacle to understanding.

Never Stop Learning
Every bug, project, and new technology is a chance to improve. A programmer is a lifelong learner.

Collaboration Over Isolation
Programming thrives when ideas are shared. Open-source, teamwork, and mentoring make us stronger.

Technology Serves People
Code should make life easier, not harder. Behind every program, there are humans who use it â€” and they matter most.

ðŸŽ¯ Goals of This Repository

To capture the lessons Iâ€™ve learned during my studies.
To share my personal principles as a programmer.
To leave a meaningful contribution at the end of my school journey.
